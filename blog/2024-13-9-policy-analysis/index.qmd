# Takeaways

# Project Background

For the last year I have been curious about how to assess whether the
passing or implementation of a policy or program has achieved its
intended result. This brings up a series of questions:

-   What is the lag between the passing and implementation of a policy?
-   How is effectiveness measured?
-   Are rules of success / failure established or investigated
    beforehand?
-   What happens if a program fails?

**Policy analysis**: process of identifying potential policy options
that could address your problem and then comparing those options to
choose the most effective, efficient, and feasible[^1].

Being able to approach a problem with a viable solution is critical to
addressing needs and building a more equitable and sustainable world.
More importantly, quantifying program impacts can guide investment and
scaling of projects to make each dollar go farther.

**Types of questions where policy analysis can be useful**

-   What is the most effective way to improve air quality?

-   How can a society optimize access to education?

-   How should a municipal government pay for an expensive
    infrastructure project?

**Types of analysis to be conducted on policy:**

-   Legal

-   Feasibility

-   Impact

-   Cost-benefit

-   Client-based

**Techniques and Methods:**

-   Stakeholder: who must be involved and who can affect the policy
    design and outcomes

-   Process: linear planning models and critical path mapping

-   Network Analysis: Exploring risk and uncertainty; estimat utility of
    alternative and its effects

-   Case study: study policy failure or in institutions can provide lots
    of information about role of stakeholders

-   Survey: collecting information from important reference gorups on
    people's attitudes

At the start of this project (Sept 13, 2024), I have some thoughts on
what will be important to measure to determine effectiveness:

-   Cost

-   Profit

-   \# People impacted

-   Quality of life

-   time

-   fulfill the need defined by the policy

Since I have never analyzed a policy, I am going to start with an
analysis that has already been done.

# Important Actors

## Policy Experts

Who: Subject matter experts, economists, community partners Why:
Interpret the policy to understand what it contains. Act as translators.

## Members affected by the policy

Who: Anyone or group who's jobs or lives may be affected by the policy
Why: Provide contextual knowledge and perspective (eg. social,
educational, cultural) to inform how a policy may impact their lives

## Implementators

Who: Public officials/administrators Why: Understand the processes of
implementation, legal landscape around policies, economic or budgetary
impacts or constraints of the policy options

# Steps

1.  Define and analyze the problem
    1.  What is the problem we are facing? Where does it exist (eg.
        urban vs rural, suburban)? Who is affected? What are the major
        causes? How might the causes be affected by policy action?
2.  Construct policy alternatives
    1.  What policy options might be considered for dealing with the
        problem?
3.  Develop criteria for evaluation
    1.  What criteria are most suitable for the problem and
        alternatives? What are the costs of action? What is the likeley
        effectiveness? Is it socially equitable? Is the policy socially
        and politically feasible?
4.  Assess the alternatives
    1.  Which alternatives are better than others? What kind of analysis
        might help distinguish better/worse policy alternatives? Is the
        evidence available? How can we produce evidence?
5.  Draw conclusions
    1.  Which policy option is the most desireable given the
        circumstances and criteria for evaluation? What other factors
        shoul dbe considered?

## Policy Models

### Linear Policy cycle model 

Accounts for the various steps in the policy making process

1.  Agenda setting (identifying issues)

Process for political prioritization

-   Window of opportunity...created when policy problems, policy
    solutions, and political support come together (Kingdon: health
    policy)

How do we make it easier to cross the street?

2.  Policy formulation

Make the street a 4-way stop at the intersection

Add speed bumps

Add crossing guard

3.  Policy adoption/Legitimization

Go to city council

Go get a petition

4.  Policy Implementation

What factors influence the collective action required to implement
policy?

*Top-down theory:* implementation is a process that can be pre-planned
and controlled by the central planners responsible for developing the
policies...but in practice this theory does not hold up.

*Bottom-up*: Process of interaction and negotiation between those
seeking tp put policy into effect and those upon whom the action depends

-   street-level bureaucracy: may resist policy change or support

-   draw on experiential knowledge, delegate power, strengthen mutual
    accountability

Install stop signs

Add paint or add speed bumps

5.  Policy assessment/evaluation

Survey people in the community (strengths / weaknesses)

Has it addressed the issue?

## Prospective policy analysis 

-   managing actor power and dynamics

-   developing advocacy strategies

-   improving prospects for evidence use in policy formulation

# Case Study 

## Select a policy

WHOS Mental health action plan 2013-2020

## Define the Context, Content, Process, and Actors relevant to policy 

## Collect data for each category
