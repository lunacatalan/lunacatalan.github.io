# Research Question

Investigated the socioeconomic factors associated with occurrence of blackouts in Houston, Texas metropolitan area that influenced recovery post blackouts. 

## Project Background 

In February 2021, Texas experienced multiple winter storms that led to power outages across the state and left over 4.5 million homes and businesses without power[^1].

# Data 

## Sources

LIGHT DATA

The VIIRS data is distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. They are identified by horizontal (h) and vertical (v) position in the grid. Houston is included in two tiles: h08v05 and h08v06. We can access tiles through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Since we have two dates, we need to access these tiles on each day.\
\

ROAD AND BUILDING DATA

Since highways account for a large amount of night lights, we want to exclude areas near highways to prevent falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power. A shapefile with all of the highways in Texas was prepared by [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/), and we compiled a subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area in a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file). We prepared a GeoPackage with only houses in the Houston Metropolitan Area using building data from OpenStreetMap which was also provided by Geofabrik.\

SOCIOECONOMIC DATA

We used the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019 as a proxy for socioeconomic information at the county level. This data is stored in a folder: `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` which has layers that can be accessed using `st_layers()`. Each layer is a subset of the fields contained in [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt).

Since the layers are separate, to access the ACS attributes associated with the geemetries you have to combine them into a single feature layer.\

## Analysis

## Results 

From the visualizations above, there was no difference in the median income distribution of counties that experienced blackouts and those that did not experience blackouts. 

The map shows that census blocks affected by blackouts seem to congregate closer to the center of Houston's metropolitan area. One issue with this analysis is that the distribution of census blocks is not uniform over the Houston area, so we can only say that it looks like more of the census tracts in the center of the metropolitan area were affected by blackouts, but the distribution of the blackouts extends outwards.

The box plot above shows that there is not a big difference in the median income distribution of census tracts that were affected by blackouts and those that were not affected. This distribution represents the aggregate of median income in each census tact which means that it is at a lower resolution than the blackout data. This has a potential to erase spatial patters within the census tracts that may represent a more accurate relationship between income and blackouts.

More exploration of income distribution at a finer spatial resolution would be beneficial to understand any economic disparities in the preparedness for buildings to handle winter storms in Houston, Texas.
