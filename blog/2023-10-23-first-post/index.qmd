## Part 1

I would love to work at the intersection between data science and policy.

Why?

1. Science communication is hard

2. People don't know how to talk to each other

3. I am good with people, and my degree in psychology has helped me understand how people make decisions[^1]


[^1]: I did a research proposal about the effect of message framing on agreement to climate change policy
