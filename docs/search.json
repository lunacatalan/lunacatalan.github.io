    "text": "Groundwater supplies water resources for drinking water and irrigated agriculture for millions of people around the world[CITE]. Groundwater levels are declining around the world. This is partly do to changing climatic trends[CITE], where declines in precipitation is leading to declines in recharge of groundwater storage in aquifers. Over the last couple of decades, agriculture production in many areas has also increased[CITE]. In arid regions, agriculture is mainly fed by groundwater since there is not enough surface water available, or it does not rain enough.\nIn the last 40 years, groundwater level declines in the Qazvin Plain, in Iran have accelerated. Past research has indicataed that agricultural production has also increased as… (Why agriculture is what I am looking at: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zahra-Mousavi-16/publication/339627057_Land_subsidence_from_interferometric_SAR_andgroundwater_patterns_in_the_Qazvin_plain_Iran/links/5f604a6a299bf1d43c04ed23/Land-subsidence-from-interferometric-SAR-andgroundwater-patterns-in-the-Qazvin-plain-Iran.pdf)\nThis analysis can help guide groundwater management strategy by shedding light on how different factors are contributing to the rapid decline, with the hope of developing effective management strategies to protect groundwater resources."

    "section": "Multiple Linear Regression with AEI mean",
    "text": "Multiple Linear Regression with AEI mean\nI conducted an OLS multiple linear regression to look at how AEI and precipitation impacted the change in groundwater level. The results of the OLS regression are shown in Figure XYZ. I used ggplot() to create a scatter plot of the mean AEI and groundwater level change over time. Then I used geom_smooth() to plot a linear regression to see how these variables changed over time. The groundwater change slope is negative, and the AEI slope is positive.\n\nir_gw_plot\n\n\n\n\nThe result of the multiple linear regression model are in Table 1, and they indicate that for every 1 ha increase in AEI, there is a 0.01 m decrease in groundwater level. The effect of AEI has a p-value of 0.032, which is small enough that there is statistical significance of this analysis. However, the p-value for annual precipitation is 0.591, meaning that there can be no statistical significance taken from the role of precipitation on grondwater level change. This model had an R^2 value of 0.50 which means it explained 50% of the variation in groundwater level change.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Results of Multiple Linear Regression of Area Equipped for Irrigation and Precipitation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Results of Simple Linear Regression of Area Equipped on Irrigation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\nThen I ran a simple linear regression model to see the effect of just AEI mean. The results in Table 2 show that the p-value is 0.02, which increases our confidence level that AEI mean is statistically significant. Here, the R^2 value has increased to 0.56, which means this model explains 56% of the variation in groundwater level change. Given the higher R^2 value, this model is more useful than the one that includes precipitation.\n{width = 50px}\nI was unhappy with the temporal resolution of the irrigation data, since it was an aggregate in 5-year chunks that was already accessing data samples. To have more confidence in my results, I calculated the SAVI from the area of a buffer around the well being used to to collect the groundwater level data, and across the aquifer in Python. Then I extracted summary statistics from each raster.\n\nsavi_plot\n\n\n\n\nI fit a linear regression model to the data as seen in Fig XYZ. This graph indicates that over time the median index value around the groundwater well was decreasing. Since the scale is from 0-1, the table results make more snese when you divide by 10. Reading it that way, for every 0.1 incrase in the SAVI index, groundwater levelsThe results of the quadratic regression are shown in Table 3, and show a statistically significant effect (p-value of 0.001) of the median SAVI in the buffer on the groundwater levels. Furthermore, the R^2 value is 0.30, which means this model accounts for 30% of the variation in groundwater level change.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Results of Simple Linear Regression of median Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) on Irrigation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\nHYPOTHESIS TESTING\nDue to the statistical significance of the median soil adjusted vegetation index and the non-statistical significance of the annual precipitation, we fail to accept the null hypothesis.\nNull Hypothesis: In the Qazvin Plain, there is no difference of the impact of annual precipitaion and agricultural production changes on groundwater level changes from 1984-2019.\nAlternative Hypothesis: In the Qazvin Plain, there is a difference of the impact of annual precipitation and agricultural production on groundwater level changes from 1984-2019.\nCONFIDENCE INTERVAL\nI calculated a confidence interval and am 95% confident that the true change in groundwater level for every 0.1 increase in the median SAVI, is within the range of 1.6 and 5.5m."

Houston is included in two tiles: h08v05 and h08v06. We can access tiles through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Since we have two dates, we need to access these tiles on each day.\n\n\nROAD AND BUILDING DATA\nSince highways account for a large amount of night lights, we want to exclude areas near highways to prevent falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power. A shapefile with all of the highways in Texas was prepared by Geofabrik’s download sites, and we compiled a subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area in a Geopackage (.gpkg file). We prepared a GeoPackage with only houses in the Houston Metropolitan Area using building data from OpenStreetMap which was also provided by Geofabrik.\n\n\nSOCIOECONOMIC DATA\nWe used the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019 as a proxy for socioeconomic information at the county level. This data is stored in a folder: ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb which has layers that can be accessed using st_layers(). Each layer is a subset of the fields contained in ACS metadata.\nSince the layers are separate, to access the ACS attributes associated with the geemetries you have to combine them into a single feature layer."

    "text": "Multiple Linear Regression with AEI mean\nI conducted an OLS multiple linear regression with lm() to look at how AEI and precipitation impacted the change in groundwater level. The results of the OLS regression are shown in Figure XYZ. I used ggplot() to create a scatter plot of the mean AEI and groundwater level change over time. Then I used geom_smooth() to plot a linear regression to see how these variables changed over time. The groundwater change slope is negative, and the AEI slope is positive.\n\n\nCode\nir_gw_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of the multiple linear regression model are in Table 1, and they indicate that for every 1 ha increase in AEI, there is a 0.01 m decrease in groundwater level. The effect of AEI has a p-value of 0.032, which is small enough that there is statistical significance of this analysis. However, the p-value for annual precipitation is 0.591, meaning that there can be no statistical significance taken from the role of precipitation on groundwater level change. This model had an R^2 value of 0.50 which means it explained 50% of the variation in groundwater level change.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Results of Multiple Linear Regression of Area Equipped for Irrigation and Precipitation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Results of Simple Linear Regression of Area Equipped on Irrigation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\nThen I ran a simple linear regression model to see the effect of just AEI mean. The results in Table 2 show that the p-value is 0.02, which increases our confidence level that AEI mean is statistically significant. Here, the R^2 value has increased to 0.56, which means this model explains 56% of the variation in groundwater level change. Given the higher R^2 value, this model is more useful than the one that includes precipitation."

    "text": "Simple Linear Regression with median Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Buffer and Aquifer crop of Landsat satellite image\n\n\nI was unhappy with the temporal resolution of the irrigation data, since it was an aggregate in 5-year chunks that was already accessing data samples. To have more confidence in my results, I calculated the SAVI from the area of a buffer around the well being used to to collect the groundwater level data, and across the aquifer in Python. Then I extracted summary statistics from each raster.\n\n\nCode\nsavi_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nI fit a linear regression model to the data as seen in Figure 3. This graph indicates that over time the median index value around the groundwater well was decreasing. Since the scale is from 0-1, the table results make more snese when you divide by 10. Reading it that way, for every 0.1 increase in the SAVI index, groundwater levels. The results of the quadratic regression are shown in Table 3, and show a statistically significant effect (p-value of 0.001) of the median SAVI in the buffer on the groundwater levels. Furthermore, the R^2 value is 0.30, which means this model accounts for 30% of the variation in groundwater level change.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Results of Simple Linear Regression of median Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) on Irrigation on Groundwater Level Change\n\n\nHYPOTHESIS TESTING\nDue to the statistical significance of the median soil adjusted vegetation index and the non-statistical significance of the annual precipitation, we fail to accept the null hypothesis.\nNull Hypothesis: In the Qazvin Plain, there is no difference of the impact of annual precipitaion and agricultural production changes on groundwater level changes from 1984-2019.\nAlternative Hypothesis: In the Qazvin Plain, there is a difference of the impact of annual precipitation and agricultural production on groundwater level changes from 1984-2019.\nCONFIDENCE INTERVAL\nI calculated a confidence interval and am 95% confident that the true change in groundwater level for every 0.1 increase in the median SAVI, is within the range of 1.6 and 5.5m."
