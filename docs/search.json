The fire destroyed over 280,00 acres, destroyed 1,063 structures and resulted in one civilian and one firefighter fatality (VCFD, 2019). Understanding the impact on Air Quality is important for public health advisories, and planning public and emergency response when the next fire occurs.\nI will create a time series graph to visualize the impact of the fire on the air quality index (AQI) of Santa Barbara County, and a false color image to understand the extent of the fire.\nThis analysis can be accessed at the repo here: Repository link"

Houston is included in two tiles: h08v05 and h08v06. We can access tiles through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Since we have two dates, we need to access these tiles on each day.\n\n\nROAD AND BUILDING DATA\nSince highways account for a large amount of night lights, we want to exclude areas near highways to prevent falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power. A shapefile with all of the highways in Texas was prepared by Geofabrik’s download sites, and we compiled a subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area in a Geopackage (.gpkg file). We prepared a GeoPackage with only houses in the Houston Metropolitan Area using building data from OpenStreetMap which was also provided by Geofabrik.\n\n\nSOCIOECONOMIC DATA\nWe used the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019 as a proxy for socioeconomic information at the county level. This data is stored in a folder: ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb which has layers that can be accessed using st_layers(). Each layer is a subset of the fields contained in ACS metadata.\nSince the layers are separate, to access the ACS attributes associated with the geemetries you have to combine them into a single feature layer."
