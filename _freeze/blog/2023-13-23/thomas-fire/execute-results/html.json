I will create a time series graph to visualize the impact of the fire on the air quality index (AQI) of Santa Barbara County, and a false color image to understand the extent of the fire. \n\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Data wrangling and exploration using `pandas`\n- Geospatial analysis of false and true color images with `geopandas` and `rioxarray`\n- Creating visualizations to give context for AQI measures as a result of the Thomas Fire\n\n## Data Information\n\n**Dataset 1: AQI**\n\nIn this task you will use [Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) data from the [US Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) to visualize the impact on the AQI of the 2017 [Thomas Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire) in Santa Barbara County. \n\n**Dataset 2: Landsat**\n\nA simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite.\n\n**Dataset 3:**\n\nA shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017. \nThe [complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about).\n\n\n# Import Libraries\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport os \nimport numpy as n\n\n\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches # to create legends\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
